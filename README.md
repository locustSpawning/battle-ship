# Battleship

## Purpose

This Battleship project was part of my self-guided education through The Odin Project JS Curriculum. The intention of this was to practice the basics of testing using Jest

## Features:

-   Interactive browser-based game akin to the Hasbro&trade; board game.
-   Smart AI that plays similarly to a human (does not "cheat")
